                Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday condemned the attack on former US President Donald Trump, emphasizing that violence has no place in politics and democracies.
                “Deeply concerned by the attack on my friend, former President Donald Trump. Strongly condemn the incident. Violence has no place in politics and democracies. Wish him a speedy recovery. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the deceased, those injured, and the American people,” Modi tweeted, tagging @realDonaldTrump.

            <h2>Sourav Ganguly, Criticised For Making Rohit Sharma Team India Captain, Fires Back</h2>
            <p>The Indian cricket team finally witnessed a high in an ICC tournament as the Rohit Sharma-led side clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 title by defeating South Africa in the final. The accomplishment earned India its first world title since the 2013 Champions Trophy triumph under MS Dhoni. While Virat Kohli had failed to earn India an ICC title as captain, Rohit brought the much-deserved success while leading the side. However, it wasn't all well in the Indian cricket spectrum when Rohit had taken over the team's captaincy from Virat. In fact, Sourav Ganguly, the then BCCI president, had received plenty of hate for the move.</p>

            <p>The CBI probe into the alleged UGC-NET paper leak has found that the “evidence”, which led the Education Ministry to cancel the exam just a day after over 9 lakh candidates appeared for it across 317 cities on June 18, was doctored, government sources told The Indian Express.
                On June 19, the Centre canceled the exam crucial for entry-level teaching jobs and PhD admissions in Indian universities, following inputs from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) that “the integrity of the examination may have been compromised”.
                The input was a screenshot of a UGC-NET paper circulating on a Telegram channel around 2 pm on the exam day (June 18), with messages and comments suggesting it was leaked before the first session.</p>
